# NUS Orbital 2021 (TeamName: NUSConnect)

Orbital (Independent Software Development Project) is NUS School of Computing self-directed, independent work course. This programme gives students the opportunity to pick up software development skills on their own, using sources on the web.

**Proposed Level of Achievement:** Apollo 11

### Milestone 1:

## Introducting Portal.io

A cross-platform mobile application (written in React Native) to help users seamlessly connect with each other.

Motivation

During the past year, we realised there are a growing number of students who have found it hard to make new friends in university, since lessons were all moved online due to Covid-19. This is a pain point for students, especially those who do not live on campus, as socialisation and meeting new people is an integral part of university life. Thus, we want to digitise the process of meeting new people, with the goal of making socialisation easy and accessible for students in a time where the COVID-19 pandemic has severely limited our ability to do so physically. 

Aim

To help university students make friends and combat the social isolation due to COVID-19. We plan to make it a cross-platform mobile app, which users can download and register for. From there, we hope users will be able to use the app to seamlessly connect with new people, and form new interest groups based on a matching algorithm. We also aim to implement additional functionality to have native support for direct messaging and forums, so as to make the user experience as fuss-free and user-friendly as possible.

Project scope:
Portal.io utilises mobile applications (for Android and iOS) as the front-end for users to interact with each other. This will be done in React Native.

A set of back-end APIs will be developed for authentication, database, push notifications and matching algorithms. This will be done using Firebase cloud functions. 

Progress (as of Milestone 1):
